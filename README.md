# Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset
- This repository contains a comprehensive data science assignment focused on analyzing an eCommerce Transactions Dataset
- The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and clustering techniques to derive actionable business insights, build recommendation models, and segment customers.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises three CSV files:

1) Customers.csv: Contains customer profiles, including details like region and signup dates.<br>
2) Products.csv: Provides product-related data such as category and price.<br>
3) Transactions.csv: Captures transaction details, including quantities, total values, and transaction dates.<br>

### Tasks and Deliverables
#### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Perform EDA on the dataset to uncover patterns and trends.
Derive 5 business insights and present them in a concise PDF report.

#### Task 2: Lookalike Model
Develop a model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
Include customer and product information for calculating similarity scores.

#### Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Segment customers using clustering techniques based on their profiles and transactions.
Choose a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) and evaluate using DB Index and other metrics.
